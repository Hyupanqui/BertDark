# Portfolio

This is a portfolio project that demonstrates my web development skills. The project is built with Astro and Tailwind, and is deployed on Fly.io.

## 🧰 Used tools
The tools I used to build this project are:
- **[Astro](https://astro.build):** a static web framework that helped me create a fast and modern website.
- **[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com):** a utility-first CSS framework that helped me style the website.
- **[Fly.io](https://fly.io):** here I deployed the website.
- **[Docker](https://docker.com):** a platform that helped me to package and implement the website in a simple and fast way.
- **[Figma](https://figma.com):** a platform that helped me to design the website.
## 🖌️ Design
To design and layout use Figma:
- Use a single page layout to simplify navigation.
- Use a responsive design so that the site looks good on different devices and screen sizes.
## 📷 Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of the site on different devices and screen sizes:

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
|   |-- fonts/
|   |   └── ....
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
